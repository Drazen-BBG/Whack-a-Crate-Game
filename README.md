# Whack-a-Crate-Game
Let's make an Unity game and start a GitHub repository

Whack a Crate is my first game on GitHub. This is my first game built with GitHub support. I am going to be using Sourcetree as a recommendation in this case but on the other hand I might be experimenting with GitHub Desktop. I am currently going through Junior Programmer pathway on Unity Learn. Enough about the technical stuff lets se what kind of game I wanna built.

During my learning process I stumbled upon an interesting project on Unity Learn and I am going to base my game on its core.
